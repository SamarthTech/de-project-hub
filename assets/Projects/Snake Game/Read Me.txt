This is a simple Snake Game made using pygame.If you want to contribute to this project, please
remember the following points:-

1. Do not change the width or height of any of the objects used in the code.
2. The random.randrange has its increment value set to 15, do not change it or else, the snake
   head's position won't ever match the apple position

Things which you can contribute to:-
1. You can create a function which increments the clock.tick(clockspeed) by 5 everytime the
   score reacher a certain point to make it harder the higher the score goes up.
2. You can create a map filled with walls where if the snake ever collides with any of the 
   walls, the game resets.
3. Introduce a score counter display ( I could not do it on my computer for I don't know what
   reason.)
4. The snake is capable of retracing it's steps ie, it can move over itself. Introduce
   the functionality to quit the game if it ever does so.
