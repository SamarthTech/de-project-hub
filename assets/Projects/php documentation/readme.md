## Introduction

PHP is a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. This repository provides a structured approach to learning PHP with detailed explanations and examples.

## Installation

To get started with PHP, you'll need to install it on your system.

### Installing PHP on Windows
1. Download the latest version of PHP from the official [PHP website](https://www.php.net/downloads).
2. Extract the files and configure environment variables to use PHP globally.

### Installing PHP on Linux
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install php
```

### Installing PHP on macOS
You can install PHP using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install php
```

To verify that PHP is installed:
```bash
php -v
```

## Basic Syntax

PHP scripts are enclosed in `<?php ?>` tags and executed on the server. Here's a simple PHP script:

```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

### Comments
- Single-line comment: `//`
- Multi-line comment: `/* ... */`

## Variables and Data Types

PHP is a loosely-typed language, which means you do not need to declare data types explicitly. Variables are declared with a `$` sign:

```php
<?php
  $name = "John";
  $age = 25;
  $isStudent = true;
?>
```

### Data Types:
- **String**
- **Integer**
- **Float**
- **Boolean**
- **Array**
- **Object**
- **Null**

## Control Structures

### If-Else Statements
```php
<?php
  if ($age > 18) {
    echo "You are an adult.";
  } else {
    echo "You are a minor.";
  }
?>
```

### Switch Statements
```php
<?php
  $day = "Monday";

  switch ($day) {
    case "Monday":
      echo "Start of the week!";
      break;
    case "Friday":
      echo "Weekend is near!";
      break;
    default:
      echo "Have a nice day!";
  }
?>
```

### Loops
- **for loop**
- **while loop**
- **foreach loop**

## Functions

PHP functions are blocks of code that can be reused. They are defined using the `function` keyword:

```php
<?php
  function greet($name) {
    return "Hello, " . $name;
  }

  echo greet("John");
?>
```

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

PHP supports OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Creating a Class
```php
<?php
  class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;

    public function __construct($make, $model) {
      $this->make = $make;
      $this->model = $model;
    }

    public function getCarInfo() {
      return $this->make . " " . $this->model;
    }
  }

  $myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
  echo $myCar->getCarInfo();
?>
```

## File Handling

PHP allows you to read, write, and append files using built-in functions like `fopen()`, `fwrite()`, and `fread()`.

### Reading a File
```php
<?php
  $file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
  while (!feof($file)) {
    echo fgets($file) . "<br>";
  }
  fclose($file);
?>
```

### Writing to a File
```php
<?php
  $file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
  fwrite($file, "This is a new line.");
  fclose($file);
?>
```

## Working with Databases

PHP is commonly used with databases like MySQL to create dynamic web applications.

### Connecting to MySQL
```php
<?php
  $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database");

  if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
  }
  echo "Connected successfully!";
?>
```

### Executing Queries
```php
<?php
  $sql = "SELECT * FROM users";
  $result = $conn->query($sql);

  while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    echo $row["username"] . "<br>";
  }
?>
```

## Error Handling

PHP provides several ways to handle errors. Common methods include `try-catch` blocks and custom error handlers.

### Example of a `try-catch` Block
```php
<?php
  try {
    if (!file_exists("example.txt")) {
      throw new Exception("File not found.");
    }
  } catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
  }
?>
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Sanitize User Input**: Use `filter_var()` and `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Use Prepared Statements**: To avoid SQL Injection, always use prepared statements with parameterized queries.
  
```php
<?php
  $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
  $stmt->bind_param("i", $id);
  $stmt->execute();
?>
```

- **Session Security**: Use secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`), and regenerate session IDs frequently.
